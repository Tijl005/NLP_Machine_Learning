# Multi-Agent WW2 Tutor (CrewAI + Groq)

Basic example project:

- CrewAI for multi-agent orchestration
- Groq LLM as the backend
- Simple WW2 notes as knowledge base
- A `search_history` tool used by a ResearchAgent
- A TutorAgent that explains things to the user

## Quickstart

```bash
cd crew_groq_ww2_assistant
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and put your real Groq API key

python main.py
```

Then ask things like:

- Explain the causes of World War II
- What was D-Day?
- What were the Axis and the Allies?
