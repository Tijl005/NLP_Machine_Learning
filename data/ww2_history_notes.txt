World War II was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945 and involved most of the world's nations, including all the great powers, organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.

The war began on 1 September 1939 when Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. Britain and France declared war on Germany shortly after, marking the start of the conflict in Europe.

The Axis Powers were primarily Germany, Italy, and Japan. They pursued expansionist policies: Germany in Europe, Italy in North Africa and the Mediterranean, and Japan in East Asia and the Pacific.

The Allies eventually included the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the United States, China, and many other countries that united against Axis aggression.

Key events in Europe include the German blitzkrieg campaigns, the Battle of Britain in 1940, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), and the D-Day landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944, which opened a Western front against Nazi Germany.

D-Day, also known as the Normandy landings, was a massive Allied amphibious invasion of German-occupied France. It marked a turning point in the war in Western Europe, as Allied forces gained a foothold that allowed them to push toward Germany.

In the Pacific, Japan attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, leading the United States to enter the war. Major Pacific battles included Midway, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.

The Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews and millions of other victims, including Romani people, disabled individuals, political dissidents, and others, carried out by Nazi Germany and its collaborators.

World War II ended in Europe with the unconditional surrender of Germany in May 1945, following Hitler's suicide and the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Allied forces.

The war ended in the Pacific after the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima (6 August 1945) and Nagasaki (9 August 1945). Japan announced its surrender on 15 August 1945, and the formal signing took place on 2 September 1945.

The consequences of World War II included unprecedented destruction, the deaths of tens of millions of people, the beginning of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the creation of the United Nations, and significant changes to political borders and global power structures.
